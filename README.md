# boggle
A weekend project to create the game Boggle using js

To use just open index.html, all scripting and css is inline in the document - probably not best practice but this took 2 days to make so I don't mind.

How to play:
Click and drag your mouse over the letters to select them and form 3-letter (or more) words.
You can only select letters that are adjacent to each other vertically, horizontally or diagonally.
Click 'New Game' to create a new board.

The logic to solve the boggle board is from Rob Dawson's online boggle solver (https://codebox.net), huge thanks to him for maintaining that API.
